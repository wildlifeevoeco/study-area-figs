# study-area-figures

Collecting WEEL study area figures in one place, for sharing! 


## Contributing:
1. Clone the repository
2. Add your script (follow the numbering scheme)
3. Add the output figure to `graphics/`, with a name and number matching the script it originates from. 
4. (Ideally) add the figure to the `README.Rmd` so we can preview them all together in one spot. 

**Note: currently the input folder is ignored, if you have small data you'd like to share, carefully remove it from the `.gitignore`**

## Currently:
1. Fogo Island


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('graphics/01-fogo-island.png')
```
