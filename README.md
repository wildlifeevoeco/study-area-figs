Collecting WEEL study area figures in one place, for sharing\!

## Contributing:

1.  Clone the repository
2.  Add your script (follow the numbering scheme)
3.  Add the output figure to `graphics/`, with a name and number
    matching the script it originates from.
4.  (Ideally) add the figure to the `README.Rmd` so we can preview them
    all together in one spot.

**Note: currently the input folder is ignored, if you have small data
youâ€™d like to share, carefully remove it from the `.gitignore`**

## Currently:

1.  Fogo Island

This uses data from Open Street Map and four packages: `osmdata`, `sf`,
`data.table` and `ggplot`.

Reproducing: run `01-fogo-island-prep.R` to generate the islands polygon
and `02-fogo-island-figure.R` to generate the figure.

``` r
knitr::include_graphics('graphics/02-fogo-island.png')
```

<img src="graphics/02-fogo-island.png" width="3200" />

2.  Newfoundland

This uses data from Open Street Map and four packages: `osmdata`, `sf`,
`data.table` and `ggplot`.

Reproducing: run `03-newfoundland-prep.R` to generate the islands
polygon and `04-newfoundland-figure.R` to generate the figure.

``` r
knitr::include_graphics('graphics/04-newfoundland.png')
```

<img src="graphics/04-newfoundland.png" width="2240" />

3.  Fogo with Newfoundland inset

This uses data from Open Street Map and four packages: `osmdata`, `sf`,
`data.table` and `ggplot`.

Reproducing: run `01-fogo-island-prep.R`, `03-newfoundland-prep.R`, to
generate the Fogo and NL polygons and
`04-fogo-inset-newfoundland-figure.R` to combine and generate the
figure.

``` r
knitr::include_graphics('graphics/05-fogo-inset-nl.png')
```
